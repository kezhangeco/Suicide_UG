## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#are faired/unfaired offers more/less likely to be accepted than rejected?
#are faired offers more likely to be rejected than unfaired offer?

print("significance of faired offers in accept vs. reject")
print(binom.test(212, 1333+212))

print("significance of unfaired offers in accept vs. reject")
print(binom.test(2481, 4008+2481))

print("significance of faired offer reject vs. unfaired offer reject")
print(binom.test(212, 212+2481))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
