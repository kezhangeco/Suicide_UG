## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# is fairness ratio orthogonal with stake size?

myData <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\ke\\ownCloud\\Suicide_UG\\UG_clean_updated\\ug_all_task_data.csv")
corr <- cor(myData$Fairness_score, myData$PlayerProposedAmount)
corr1 <- cor(myData$Fairness_score, myData$OpponentProposedAmount)
corr2 <- cor(myData$Fairness_score, myData$TotalAmountAtStake)
print(corr)
print(corr1)
print(corr2)
```

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
