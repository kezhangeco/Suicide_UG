## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(foreign)
hsb2 <- read.table('https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hsb2-2.csv', header=T, sep=",")


if (file.exists("hsb.rds")){
    hsb <- readRDS("hsb.rds")
} else {
    hsb.url <- "http://www.stata-press.com/data/mlmus3/hsb.dta"
    hsb <- read.dta(hsb.url)
    saveRDS(hsb, "hsb.rds")
}

hsb1 <- read.dta('hsb1.dta')
```
```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
