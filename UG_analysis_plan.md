# UG analysis plan 

### Hypothesis 1: Participants in all groups punished their counterparts for unfair offer. However, low-lethality attempters, non-suicidal depression, ideators, and controls punished less as the cost of punishment increased, accepting more unfair offers as the stakes grew large. High-lethality attempters did not adjust their choices based on stake magnitude, punishing unfair offers without regard to the cost.

#### Binary logistic generalized mixed model (GLMM)

- Examines the acceptance of offer in HL attempters and other groups
- Nest each trials of binary values to the model

#### Multilevel structural equation modeling (MLSEM)

- examine effects of potential intervening variables (sensitivity of unfairness)
- We only included the eight moderately equitable and eight very unequitable trials in these analyses, as variance in rejection rates of the fair (equitable) trials was minimal

### Hypothesis 2: Groups have different judgment or sensitivity to fairness. It may explain a large proportion of the difference in acceptance. High-lethality attempters judged offers based on the inequality. The comparison groups judged offers based on the combination of inequality and magnitudes.



### data clean

1. Merge context, baseline, and demo data into 1 panel sheet.

2. One person changed from LL attempter to ideator

3. Exclude those age under 50

4. group ideator-attempters as attempters

### data description

1. Demographic, clinical, and SES indicators, those continuous measure  are compared across the 5 groups by ANOVA.

   **groups:**

   - CONTROL-CONTROL
   - DEPRESSION-DEPRESSION(non-suicidal)
   - SUICIDAL-IDEATOR
   - SUICIDAL-ATTEMPTER: HL, LL
     - HL>=4
     - LL<4

   **Demographic and SES:**

   - age
   - education
   - gender (% men)
   - race(% white) 
   - marital status

   **Clinical:**

   - sensitivity to fairness

2. Categorical data are compared by chi-square tests across the groups (if there's any categorical data)

3. Percentage of acceptance:

   1) calculate the percentage of acceptance of unfair offer in aggregate level

   2) calculate the percentage of acceptance of unfair offer by groups


   3) calculate the percentage of acceptabce under control and task context.



## GLMM MODEL

- Goal: whether suicide attempters responded differently to unfaireness and stake during UG.
- Binary logistic generalized mixed model (GLMM)
- Parameter estimates were derived using MLE based on adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule.

## Mutllevel structural equarion modelling (MLSEM)

- Goal: whether the effect of stake on acceptance was influenced by income, implusivity, exective control, interpersonal dysfunction.
- Each participant contribute 16 trials.
- decomposes the data into within-subject and between-subjects components, allow models for each level.
